ASCOM wrapper for *pyobs*
=========================

This package provided some *pyobs* modules for wrapping devices accessible via
ASCOM in Windows. It is optimized to run with the telescope setup at the 
Institut for Astrophysics in GÃ¶ttingen, so for everyone else it's just supposed
to be an inspiration for their own implementation.
